These are the Thoughts of Nathan Rhoda 
From tomorrow i am going to get up every morning for the next week and do at least 1 hour cycling 10 minutes stretching 
and 10 minutes abs. Followed up with a 30 min sauna session 20 minutes straight sauna 5 minute break and 5 more minutes to close out.

I will continue this routine for a week until I average 35 km a hour for a hour on the stationary bike.
